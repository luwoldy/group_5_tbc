## Problem Statement a.k.a Decompose The Ask

 How do news headlines affect the stock price of a company on a daily, weekly, monthly basis

## Identify Data Sources
1. [News API](https://newsapi.org/docs)
2. [Intellexer](https://intellexer.com/)
3. [Alphavantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)



## Define Strategy and Metrics
We plan on searching the news api for articles about a fortuen 100 company on a given day. We'll have to
use the Intellexer Named Entity Recognizer to make sure the article is about the company. 

Once this is confirmed we will use the sentiment analyzer to get a negative or positive value for the headline. 

Then we'll see the stock price for that company using Alphavantage
